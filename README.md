# CovidSim
CovidSim, Is simple agent based model to try and replicate the spread of covid 19 when given a scenario. 
A test Scenario is currently available to use, it's pretty poor though


Im designing CovidSim to not be realistic but to try and push myself to build a model for school project.

CovidSim isn't very fleshed out at the moment but will over time be expanded on.
The main functionality of the model will come first but over time I will try to add more features.

CovidSim stil has to bugs to iron out and currently infection doesn't work as chance of being infected is 0.
At some point I hope to release some documentation for it

Features Currently present:
    1) Scenario editor
    2) Scenario Import
    3) Select random agent to follow on a single count
    4) escape from the model whilst it's running using the escape key

Some functionality will include:
    2) Having a scenario generator
    3) A graphical display. Very Unlikely but possible
