# CovidSim
CovidSim, Is simple agent based model to try and replicate the spread of covid 19 when given a scenario. 

Im designing CovidSim to not be realistic but to try and push myself to build a model for school project.

CovidSim isn't very fleshed out at the moment but will over time be expanded on.
The main functionality of the model will come first but over time I will try to add more features.

Features Currently present:
    1) Scenario editor
    2) Scenario Import

Some functionality will include:
    1) Having a scenario editor
    2) Having a scenario generator
    3) A graphical display. Very Unlikely but possible
